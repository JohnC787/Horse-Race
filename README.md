# Horse-Race
## Create constants
## Set the number of horses to 5
## Set the track length to 15 spaces
## Create an array to store each horse's position
## Set all horse positions to 0 for the starting line
## Use a random device and generate a random number 0 or 1 to simulate a coin flip
## Tell the user to press the Enter key to start the game and advance the horses in the race
## Repeat the race until there is a winner where the user keeps pressing Enter
## For each horse there is a coin flip and if the flip is heads (1) the horse moves forward one space
## If the coin flip is tails (0) the horse stays in its place
## Print the horse's lane on the track
## Check if the horse has passed the finish line and if a horse has won the race ends
## Announce the winning horse
